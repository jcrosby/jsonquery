JSONQuery provides a comprehensive set of data querying tools including 
filtering, recursive search, sorting, mapping, range selection, and flexible 
expressions with wildcard string comparisons and various operators.

Quick Example:
    var data = {customers:[
      {name:"Susan", purchases:29},
      {name:"Kim", purchases:150}, 
      {name:"Jake", purchases:27}
    ]};

    var results = JSONQuery("$.customers[?purchases > 21 & name='Jake'][\\purchases]",data);

    returns customers sorted by higest number of purchases to lowest.
